  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <p>
My name is Luis Castillo. I was born in Mexico and came to the US in when I was three years old. I grew up in a small agriculture town in the Central-Coast part of California, and I’m currently attending San Jose State University. My Major is graphic design, but I’m am interested in all sorts of mediums of expression like fashion, television, music, art, film, and video.
<br>
<br>
All of my interests influence my work. For example, The plot of a movie might inspire the layout of a website or an album I’m listening to might influence the concept of a video and so on. Every theory or idea I come across in life is the inspiration for my work.
